# MongoDB Explained

## What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is open source **NoSQL database** that uses a document-oriented data model. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). Unlike relational databases, MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, which makes it ideal for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. It is designed for scalability, high performance, and ease of development.

**Key Features and concepts**:

**Document Oriented**:
Data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents, which can vary in structure, allowing for easier handling of diverse data types. 

**Scalability and High Availability**:
MongoDB is designed for horizontal scaling (adding more machines) and replication, enabling high availability and performance for large-scale applications. 

**Flexible Schema**:
MongoDB's schema is dynamic, meaning you don't need a predefined structure for your data. This allows for easier iteration and adaptation as your application evolves. 

**BSON**:
MongoDB uses BSON (Binary JSON) to store data, which is a binary representation of JSON that can accommodate more data types than standard JSON.

## What are Collections and Documents?
- **Document**: The basic unit of data in MongoDB. A document is similar to a JSON object, containing field-value pairs. Documents in the same collection can have different fields and structures. The `_id` field is a unique identifier for each document and is automatically generated by MongoDB.  
Example:
```json
{
  "name": "Tariq",
  "age": 30,
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "Python"]
}
```


- **Collection**: A container for documents, similar to a table in a relational database. Collections group related documents together. A database can contain multiple collections. Unlike relational databases, MongoDB collections don’t enforce a strict schema, allowing for flexibility in document structure.

## MongoDB Architecture
The structure of MongoDB consists of a schema-less model that manages data in dynamic and complex structures. Components such as the server, shard, and storage engine operate seamlessly to perform data operations.

## What are Replica Sets?
A **replica set** is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set to ensure high availability and redundancy.

### How do they work?
- One node is **primary**, others are **secondaries**
- All writes and reads (by default) go to the primary
- If the primary fails, an election occurs and a secondary becomes the new primary

### Advantages
- High availability
- Automatic failover
- Data redundancy

### Disadvantages
- Increased complexity
- Risk of stale reads on secondaries
- Delays in replication under high load

## What is Sharding?

Sharding is a method of distributing data across multiple machines (shards) to handle large datasets and high throughput. It allows for horizontal scaling, meaning you can add more machines to your cluster to increase storage capacity and performance as needed. 


### How does it work in MongoDB specifically?
1. Data is partitioned based on a **shard key**
2. Each chunk of data is sent to a shard (a replica set)
3. `mongos` is the query router that directs requests to the correct shard

### Advantages
- Linear scalability for large datasets
- Load balancing for high throughput
- Enables geographically distributed data

### Disadvantages
- Requires careful selection of shard key
- Complex to manage and monitor
- Potential for uneven data distribution

## MongoDB Use Cases

### 1. Content Management Systems (CMS)
Forbes adopted MongoDB Atlas to modernise their outdated, on-premises CMS, which was difficult to maintain and lacked flexibility. Moving to a cloud-based solution gave them a faster, more scalable platform that supports rapid development and seamless feature integration. MongoDB’s flexible data model allowed their teams to cut build times from 25 minutes to just 9.

This upgrade improved both developer productivity and reader experience, with faster page rendering and simpler maintenance. Forbes now plans to implement Atlas Search to further enhance search performance and continue delivering innovation at speed.

### 2. Internet of Things (IoT)
Bosch uses MongoDB to manage and process complex IoT data in real time. Its flexible schema and efficient querying make it ideal for high-volume sensor data, which often varies in structure.

A key use case is Bosch IoT Insights, a platform that collects data from tools used in aircraft manufacturing. It monitors torque and angle values, alerting operators when they’re off spec, improving safety and compliance. Bosch also uses MongoDB to analyze data from car engine control units (ECUs), helping engineers understand real-world usage and refine product designs based on actual user behavior.
